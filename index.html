           Thank you for visiting!
           Here’s a quick story about me and this website.

            My journey into programming began a few years ago, driven by curiosity and a strong interest in technology. Over time, I developed a passion for building real-world applications, especially using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website is one of my ongoing Web Development Projects, where I’ve implemented features like sign-up and login systems, UI enhancements, and eventually plan to integrate third-party login methods like Google and Facebook authentication.

            Right now, I’m actively working on an Employee Database Management System, which reflects my interest in combining front-end interfaces with logic and user data management. I love solving problems — from simple DOM manipulation tasks to more interactive and dynamic challenges.

            I also enjoy experimenting with UI/UX improvements, animations, and responsive layouts. Creating something visually appealing and functional gives me a real sense of achievement.

            <br><br>
            Languages & Tools I Use:
            Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python
            Concepts: DOM Manipulation, Local Storage, Responsive Design, Form Validation
            Tools: Git & GitHub, VS Code, Browser DevTools
            Libraries: AOS (Animate on Scroll), GSAP, Google SDK (in progress)

            If you're reading this — thanks for being part of the journey!
